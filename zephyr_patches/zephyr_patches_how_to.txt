Some additional patches are required to be applied to the Zephyr kernel
for building the Basic ECFW App. The current EC App is based out of
Zephyr v3.2 and hence these patches need to be applied on that branch.
These patches are expected to be part of the future Zephyr releases (if
they are not already integrated).

Note: Below steps assume environment has been setup as indicated in the
main Nuvoton Open source EC FW documentation.


1) Clone and check out the main branch from zephyr(upstream)
git clone https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr.git
cd zephyr
git checkout tags/v3.2.0
git checkout -b my_new_branch tags/v3.2.0


2) Apply zephyr patches on to the kernel branch
git am ../ecfw/zephyr_patches/*.patch

3) Building the code for NPCX4_evb (for e.g)
cd ../ecfw
west build -p always -b npcx4mnx_demo app/demo
